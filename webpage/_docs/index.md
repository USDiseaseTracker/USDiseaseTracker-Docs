Welcome to the US Disease Tracker documentation repository. This site provides comprehensive data standards, templates, examples, and validation documentation for the US Disease Tracker project.

### Quick Start

The US Disease Tracker project provides consolidated epidemiologically sound data, analytics, and insights for monitoring and responding to disease threats across the United States.

**Key Dates:**
- **Data Start:** December 29, 2024 (MMWR week 1, 2025)
- **Submission Frequency:** Weekly (preferred)

**Current Diseases Collected:**

| Disease | Time Aggregation | Confirmation Status | Outcomes |

| Measles | Weekly | Confirmed only | Cases |
| Pertussis | Monthly | Confirmed and probable (combined) | Cases |
| Invasive Meningococcal Disease | Monthly | Confirmed and probable (combined) | Cases |

### Key Principles

#### 1. Voluntary Participation
Provision of data is voluntary and based on individual jurisdiction capabilities and policies.

#### 2. Aggregate Data Only
- No line-level data will be collected
- Data are subject to suppression in accordance with individual jurisdiction policies, regulations, and laws
- Ensures patient privacy and minimizes reidentification risk

#### 3. Data Updates and Versioning
- Data should be updated and back-populated on a regular basis
- Records of prior versions will be maintained
- Recent data may be incomplete as investigations proceed

#### 4. Data Integrity
- We do not manipulate or suppress data once received
- Jurisdictions submit only data they are comfortable posting publicly
- Only data supplied by jurisdictions will be posted publicly

*NOTE: Data for the pilot will **not** be released publicly. Once the pilot is completed and additional states are invited to participate, the dashboard and reported data are intended to become public.*
