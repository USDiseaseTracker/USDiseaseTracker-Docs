                                                                                                                                                                         **US Disease Data Project**  
**Guidance on Data Standards for Pilot Phase**  
(work in progress, last updated 10/13/2025)

1. # Background

This document proposes detailed specifications to state, tribal, local, and territorial health departments that will participate in a pilot for the Data Dashboard project, a collaborative initiative by CSTE, ASTHO, and Johns Hopkins University, along with epidemiologists and public health officials, to develop a publicly available dashboard for data sharing, visualization and analyses of selected diseases, focusing initially on vaccine preventable disease case counts. For background information about the project, see slides and documents listed here:

·         [Data Dashboard Project Charter.docx](https://cste.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/ERDgYNKaMUxNrk3eK0EZsXkB2z87SC7OVTASmf_Jk-t07Q?e=FAcBJE)

The specifications provided below have been developed with input from the Joint Data Dashboard Steering Committee (SC) and Technical Advisory Group (TAG) and are intended to provide guidance for jurisdictions participating in a pilot for the project. This document will be updated as needed during the pilot and also following the pilot based on lessons learned, and as advised by the SC and TAG.

A major goal of this project is to produce epidemiologically sound data that is as standardized as possible, recognizing that there are individual variations in how and when data are collected and available to participating health departments. Some of these differences can be accommodated as we proceed with the pilot. It is also recognized that data on individual cases will accumulate and change as time passes, and more recent case data will likely be incomplete as investigations are proceeding and may need to be updated.

**Key points**

* Provision of data is voluntary  
* Data are in aggregate only (no line-level data), and are subject to data suppression in accordance with the policies/regulations and laws of individual contributing jurisdictions, in order to ensure patient privacy and to minimize any risk of reidentification.  
* Data are to be updated and back-populated on a regular basis as new data are made available, and records of prior versions of the data will be maintained.   
* JHU does not manipulate or suppress the data once received. Participating jurisdictions should submit the data/counts they are comfortable posting on the dashboard, and JHU will only post what is supplied.  
* Data for the pilot will not be released publicly. The intent is for the data and dashboard, once the pilot is completed and additional states are invited to participate to be posted on the JHU website and to become public.

2. # Summary of Data Submission

**Data submission frequency:** Weekly (monthly submission can be arranged if weekly is not possible, in coordination with project team)

**Data submission components:**

For all cases to date (as classified by calculated case counting date or similar) starting 12/29/24 (start of MMWR week 1\)

          IMPORTANT: Each each aggregation stream should have complete

Measles (confirmed only):   
·        Cases \* week \* jurisdiction (state, DC, NYC, or territory)  
·        Cases \* week \* sub-jurisdiction unit (county, planning area, etc.)  
·        Cases \* month \* jurisdiction (state, DC, NYC, or territory)  
·        Cases \* month \* sub-jurisdiction unit (county, planning area, etc.)  
·        Cases \* month \* jurisdiction \* age

Pertussis (confirmed and probable):   
·        Cases \* month \* jurisdiction (state, DC, NYC, or territory)  
·        Cases \* month \* sub-jurisdiction unit (county, planning area, etc.)  
·        Cases \* month \* jurisdiction \* age  
   
Meningococcus (confirmed and probable):   
·         Cases \* month \* jurisdiction (state, DC, NYC, or territory)  
·         Cases \* month \* sub-jurisdiction unit (county, planning area, etc.)  
·         Cases \* month \* jurisdiction \* age  
·         Cases \* month \* jurisdiction \* serogroup

3. # Reportable Data {#reportable-data}

   

   1. ## Reportable diseases

   During the Pilot Phase, three diseases have been selected for reporting. Additional diseases may be added after the Pilot Phase.

      

* Measles (caused by measles virus)  
* Pertussis (caused by *Bordetella pertussis* bacteria)  
* Invasive meningococcal disease (caused by *Neisseria meningitidis* bacteria)

  2. ## Time period for reporting 

  Case counts are requested beginning 12/29/24\* through the present. This is to provide a reasonable baseline of data for visualization for purposes of the pilot.


  \*The start of MMWR week 1 and MMWR year 2025\.


  3. ## Time aggregation

  Of the three diseases selected for the pilot, aggregate counts are requested in the following units of time:


* Measles \- monthly and weekly  
* Pertussis \- monthly  
* Meningococcus \- monthly 


  As outlined above, all diseases are requested aggregated by month. In addition, measles counts aggregated by week is also requested to allow for more timely updates and enhanced situational awareness.


  4. ## Frequency of data reporting

  Classification of cases by time and reporting cadence are independent of each other.


  Data should be reported weekly during non-emergency periods by each jurisdiction. 


  Weekly reports can include either:

1. Full report of all requested diseases aggregated by week and month.  
   1. In this format, reports would include a refresh of all historic weekly and monthly aggregated data in addition to the new week’s data, and may or may not include counts to date for the current month, depending on the discretion of the reporting jurisdiction.  
2. Variable weekly reports, such that a full report, as described above, is sent once per month and remaining weekly reports include only those diseases aggregated by week (i.e. measles only).

   

   For additional details about weekly data transfers and file format, see [Section 5\. Data Transfer](#data-transfer).

   *Note: During certain situations, e.g., large outbreaks or public health emergencies, more frequent (e.g., daily or weekly) updates may be requested to improve situational awareness.*

   5. ## Data lags and incompleteness {#data-lags-and-incompleteness}

   Jurisdictions should aim to share all cases as soon as they are adjudicated as confirmed or probable within the relevant reporting period.

   As data from the most recent weeks or months may be incomplete, the project team will ensure portrayal of such data will take this into account clearly and transparently. This may include dashed lines on epidemic curves to portray data as provisional, asterisks and notes detailing the data completeness limitations, etc. It should be noted, the project team will not censor data reported by jurisdictions in any way and will always display data as they have been reported. The project team will work with the participating jurisdictions to ensure the details on completeness are fully understood and portrayed correctly.

   6. ## Confirmation status of cases

   The confirmation status of required reporting will be defined for each disease in coordination with participating jurisdictions, based on epidemiological relevance and current reporting practices. For the initial three diseases, these are as follows:

   Cases to be reported:

* Measles \- *confirmed* only  
* Pertussis \- *probable* and *confirmed* combined  
* Meningococcus \- *probable* and *confirmed* combined

  7. ## Assigning cases to geographical locations

  Cases should be included in aggregated counts for geographical locations according to their *place of residence*, in accordance with standard epidemiologic practice in the US (see [CSTE Position Statement 11-SI-04](https://learn.cste.org/images/dH42Qhmof6nEbdvwIIL6F4zvNjU1NzA0MjAxMTUy/Course_Content/Case_based_Surveillance_for_Syphilis/CSTE_Revised_Guidelines_for_Determining_Residency_for_Disease_Reporting_Purposes.pdf) for details).


  





4. # Data Elements

Note: Certain data elements are subject to validation rules. Values submitted that are not in alignment with listed values may result in a validation error. See [data dictionary and sample data file](https://cste.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/EYIPI-VSAaJAqJlUfPpwoagBrjHTQaM862FGjLfhoPjXsA?e=OtN9Ql) for data element definitions and a list of valid value sets for each.

1. ## Reporting period and dates

Relevant data fields: *time\_unit, report\_period\_start, report\_period\_end, date\_type*

**Classification of cases in time**  
Cases should be classified according to a hierarchical date algorithm. CSTE strongly recommends participants use the Calculated Case Counting Date (CCCD) ([Data Standardization: Workgroup Proposal for Standardized Case Counting Date](https://cdn.ymaws.com/www.cste.org/resource/resmgr/2015weston/DSWG_BestPracticeGuidelines_.pdf)) if possible. This standardized method employs a hierarchy and assigns the case to the earliest of symptom onset date, clinical diagnosis date, earliest specimen collection date associated with a positive lab result, earliest result date for a positive lab result, date first received by a public health agency, date entered/record initiated. If that is not possible or not implemented in your jurisdiction, please classify cases according to a similar algorithm or use an existing case classification date such as Event Date in your system. Data should be provided in the metadata file on the details of the algorithm used, for each jurisdiction.

Using the CCCD or other hierarchical date type, weekly counts of cases should be classified by MMWR week (see [MMWR week table](https://ndc.services.cdc.gov/wp-content/uploads/MMWR-Weeks-Calendar_2024-2025.pdf)). Monthly counts should be classified using groupings of 4-5 corresponding MMWR weeks (see [MMWR week to month crosswalk](https://cste.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/EYIPI-VSAaJAqJlUfPpwoagBrjHTQaM862FGjLfhoPjXsA?rtime=8l2fm2Ig3kg&ActiveCell=MMWR%20week%20to%20month)). This crosswalk assigns the start of each month as the start of the first MMWR week that includes at least four days of the new calendar month.   
Year-to-date counts by age group should be classified as the start of MMWR week 1 (2024-12-29) through the end of the last included MMWR week.

Report period start/end (report\_period\_start/report\_period\_end) values.

| report\_period\_start/report\_period\_endvalues accepted | Value status | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| *{week start/end date}* | Currently accepted | If reporting weekly counts, start/end date of MMWR week reporting period. Formatted as YYYY-MM-DD. |
| *{month start/end date}* | Currently accepted | If reporting monthly counts, start/end date of MMWR month reporting period. Formatted as YYYY-MM-DD. |
| *{year start/end date}* | Currently accepted | If reporting year-to-date counts, start/end date of MMWR year reporting period. Formatted as YYYY-MM-DD. |

Date type (date\_type) values:

| date\_type values accepted | Value status | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| *cccd* | Currently accepted | Calculated Case Counting Date, |
| *jurisdiction date hierarchy* | Currently accepted | Other jurisdiction-defined date hierarchy. Jurisdictions should send details of hierarchies to project team. |

Time unit (time\_unit) values:

| time\_unit values accepted | Value status | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| *week* | Currently accepted | Week of counts |
| *month* | Currently accepted | Month of counts |
| *ytd* | Currently accepted | Counts year-to-date. This option is specifically to be used as an alternative option for reporting age-specific counts, instead of weekly or monthly counts. |

2. ## Age group 

Relevant data fields: *age\_group*

Age groups are defined to be relevant to both disease epidemiology and vaccine schedules. A decision was made to use the same age groupings for every disease to simplify visualizations and reduce the need for disease-specific coding. See age groups below. While these are fairly granular age groups, if data are sparse or as agreed to by the project team and participating jurisdictions, age groups may be further aggregated for visualization. We aim to make the data as accessible and informative as possible for epidemiologists but also have visualizations that will be understandable and clear for the public, hence proposal to provide granular data but also allow for fewer categories depending on the user (ideally the dashboard will be interactive and support user choice for the number of age groups visible). 

**Age groups will only be shared and displayed at the jurisdiction level,** not at sub-jurisdiction level unless otherwise agreed to by individual jurisdictions and possibly under particular circumstances such as large localized outbreaks. The project team can accept age group data shared at the sub-jurisdiction level but it is not required.  
	

| age\_group values accepted | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| *0-11 m* | from 6 m and 0 days up to but not including 1 year birthday |
| *1-4 y* | from 1 year birthday up to but not including 5 year birthday |
| *5-11 y* | from 5 year birthday up to but not including 12 year birthday |
| *12-18 y* | from 12 year birthday up to but not including 19 year birthday |
| *19-22 y* | from 19 year birthday up to but not including 23 year birthday |
| *23-44 y* | from 23 year birthday up to but not including 45 year birthday |
| *45-64 y* | from 45 year birthday up to but not including 65 year birthday |
| *\>=65 y* | from 65 year birthday and older  |
| *total* | Total counts, all ages |
| *unknown* | Counts of individuals with unknown age, when reporting age for remainder of counts. |

3. ## Disease Name

   Name of the disease or pathogen that is being reported.

   

Disease name (disease\_name) values:

| disease\_name values accepted | Value status | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| *measles* | Currently accepted | Measles |
| *pertussis* | Currently accepted | pertussis |
| *meningococcus* | Currently accepted | Invasive disease caused by infection with the bacteria Neisseria meningitidis. |

4. ## Disease Subtype

   Subspecies, type, strain, or other distinguishing classification of the disease or pathogen that is important for reporting and tracking. For invasive meningococcal disease, this enables the option to provide serogroup once/if it is available. Optional values will be A, B, C, Y, W, “unknown”, and “unspecified”. disease\_subtype is not required and should be left NA if not reporting subtype for a particular disease (i.e., for measles and pertussis).

 


| disease\_subtype values accepted | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| *A, B, C, W, X, Y* | Specific subtypes of Neisseria meningitidis. If additional subtypes are needed, these should be requested. |
| *unknown* | No subtyping was performed; used when subtypes are reported for the disease and aggregation level otherwise. |
| *unspecified* | Subtype not being reported for particular value, but is known by the jurisdiction (i.e., censored small number counts for a specific county or age group).  |
| *NA* | Subtype is not being reported for the disease in any aggregation level |

   5. ## Geographic Fields

Relevant data fields: *reporting\_jurisdiction, geo\_unit, geo\_name*

Sub-jurisdiction level (below state, territory, or city level) reporting is optimal to maximize the usefulness and impact of the data for preparedness and response. Health departments will decide the geographic unit they will use, and this could vary by disease. A list of geographic units should be included by each jurisdiction as part of the metadata so validation tools can ensure data accuracy and consistency.

For data points where disaggregation results in data suppression, for example age group, data may be reported and/or displayed separately at state-level only. These situations will be discussed further and specifics will be defined in the future. Individual jurisdictions will work together with the project team to determine the geographic granularity of the data they share for each disease.

Reporting jurisdiction (reporting\_jurisdiction): 

| reporting\_jurisdiction values accepted | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| *{jurisdiction abbreviation}* | Abbreviation for the reporting state, city, or territory. Value examples: AL, AK, AZ…, WY, DC, NYC, other territory (i.e., PR) |

State/territory encapsulating location of counts (state): 

| state values accepted | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| *{state/territory abbreviation}* | Abbreviation for the reporting state, city, or territory. Currently only accepts 2-letter abbreviation of state or territory, including: AL, AK, AZ…, WY, DC, other territory (i.e., PR) |

Geographical unit of the counts (geo\_unit): 

| geo\_unit values accepted | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| *county* | County |
| *state* | state |
| *hsa* | Health Service Area |
| *planning area* | Planning area |
| *region* | Any jurisdiction-defined geographical region not captured otherwise |
| *other* | Other geographical designation |
| *NA* | Not Available / no data available |

	  
Geographic unit name (geo\_name): 

| geo\_name values accepted | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| *{name of geo\_unit element}* | Name of geographical unit (i.e., county, region, territory, state name). If international resident count, should be entered as “*international resident*”. |

6. ## Count

Relevant data fields: *count*

Number of outcome events for specified reporting period, geographical unit, age group, and other disaggregation group.

7. ## Confirmation Status

	Relevant data fields: *confirmation\_status*

Confirmation status (confirmation\_status): 

| confirmation\_statusvalues accepted\* | Value status | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| *“confirmed”* | Currently accepted | Confirmed case |
| *“confirmed and probable”* | Currently accepted | Confirmed or probable, aggregated. Used for diseases that may take longer to confirm (i.e., pertussis, meningococcus) |

8. ## Outcome

Relevant data fields: *outcome*

Initially, only cases will be reported. Cases are defined by the CSTE case definitions as documented in the [Position Statement Archive](https://www.cste.org/page/PositionStatements) (search by disease to find the specific case definitions). We aim to add additional outcomes (i.e., deaths, hospitalizations) after this initial implementation.

| outcome values accepted\* | Value status | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| *cases* | Currently accepted | Cases of disease |
| *hospitalizations* | *Future* | Hospitalizations caused by disease |
| *deaths* | *Future* | Deaths caused by disease |

9. ## International travel

   At this time, we will not be including travel status or exposure location variables/information. Ideally, this project will track whether cases are associated with international (and possibly domestic) travel as this helps inform public health policy and practice. Discussion of inclusion of recent travel status will be deferred until later.

   

   IMPORTANT: *International residents*, international travelers who are not residents of the reporting jurisdiction but were identified in that jurisdiction, can be included in reported data, but they should be designated as an international resident using the field details below and excluded from jurisdiction total counts and age group stratifications. These cases will be excluded from any displayed totals, epidemic curves, etc. for the jurisdiction.

   

- geo\_name \= “international resident”   
- geo\_unit \= “NA”


  


  

International traveler values:

| outcome values accepted\* | Value status | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| cases | Currently accepted | Cases of disease |
| hospitalizations | *Future* | Hospitalizations caused by disease |
| deaths | *Future* | Deaths caused by disease |

5. # Data Transfer  {#data-transfer}

   1. ## Data transfer frequency

   Data transfer frequency proposed: *Weekly*

   

   A single file with all diseases and cases aggregated by week or month of the calculated case counting date (depending on the condition, see [3\. Reportable Data](#reportable-data)) should be transferred to the project database on a weekly basis unless an exception has been agreed to by the project team. This file will be regenerated and updated each week with new data including changes to aggregate values provided previously (see [*b. Data transfer format*](#data-transfer-format)). If there are no updates to the data, submission of either a statement “No data updates for this week” or the current file with no changes is required, to ensure data are not assumed missing. 

   

   For diseases that are defined to be reported on monthly timescales, jurisdictions can opt to update monthly totals each week, or update month counts following completion of the reporting month. Counts will be defined as “provisional” for a specified lag period on any visualizations (see [2.C. Data lags and incompleteness](#data-lags-and-incompleteness)).

   

   Individual requests to transfer data monthly can be discussed between the jurisdiction and project team, but weekly data sharing is strongly preferred.

   2. ## Data transfer format {#data-transfer-format}

   Each reporting jurisdiction (i.e., state health department) will use the template provided (linked [here](https://cste.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/EYIPI-VSAaJAqJlUfPpwoagBrjHTQaM862FGjLfhoPjXsA?e=2Xea8R)) to report according to the timing specified for each pathogen. Each week or month a file should be submitted with the reported incident disease counts *since December 29, 2024* (i.e., add rows each week for new cases). Transferred files will be date-stamped by the system to record the date and help maintain version control. Any changes to prior observation counts will be taken as revisions to the data for prior time points.

      1. #### No Zero Reporting 

   Reported data should only include non-zero counts. If a jurisdiction or age group did not have a reported outcome during a specific reporting timeframe, no entry is required. The database system will automatically add 0s at higher spatial aggregations (state, city) for data tracking.

      2. #### Data format example

![][image1]

3. ## Data suppression for small counts

   Jurisdictions participating in the pilot will work together with the project team to ensure that visualized data do not risk reidentification of individual patients. In general, jurisdictions can leverage their existing policies regarding suppression of small numerators or where underlying populations are small enough to risk reidentification. 

   

   For counts that cannot be released, these should be suppressed by the jurisdiction prior to sharing data. As a general rule, to ensure that total counts add to 100% of total cases, cases that cannot be assigned to specific disaggregations should be aggregated in a category labelled “unspecified”. 

   

   For example, if counts for a particular county in a particular week are too low to be publicly released, but counts for other counties in that week are sufficient to be released, according to jurisdiction rules, the counts for counties that need to be suppressed should be aggregated across suppressed counties and reported together as \`geo\_name \= “unspecified”\` category. This allocation should be done prior to data release by the jurisdiction. Technical assistance may be available to assist with developing code to perform these operations. All suppression rules should be shared from the jurisdiction to the project team for awareness and accurate description/footnoting of the data.

   

   For measles the project team recommends not suppressing data as a default \- and releasing any cases that have already been publicly released, but can discuss any requests to suppress data with individual jurisdictions.

6. # Data Transfer Methods

The project team is working with the submitting jurisdictions to provide several mechanisms for data transfer. Three options are currently being explored for development:

1. Manual data upload via a website portal  
2. Scheduled pull of data by JHU from jurisdiction data portals.  
3. Scheduled push of data by jurisdictions to JHU API.

During the pilot, mechanisms that match the current capabilities of jurisdictions will be prioritized for development.

For more details, see [Appendix 1\. Data Transfer Options](#appendix-1.-data-transfer-options).

# Appendix 1\. **Data Transfer Options** {#appendix-1.-data-transfer-options}

The JHU team intends to provide data transfer options that meet the needs of states participating in the U.S. Disease Tracker (USDT).  Discussion with the TAG lead us to believe that the following options would all be useful:

1\.       File Upload (Manual)

a.       User uses web browser to open the USDT data upload website

b.       User logs in, including 2-factor authentication

c.       User uploads data file

d.       System validates file (format, data types, other data reasonableness checks)

e.       If valid, file is uploaded successfully, a success message is displayed to the user, a log entry is made in the system recording the successful upload, and an email message containing the contents of the log entry is emailed to the email address on file for the given state.

f.         If invalid, file is not stored, an error message containing a description of the problems with the file is displayed to user, a log entry is made in the system recording the unsuccessful attempt and associated errors, and an email message containing the contents of the log entry is emailed to the email address on file for the given state.

2\.       Scheduled pull of data by JHU from State to JHU (Automated)

a.       JHU, using an example script provided by the state, connects to the state’s data portal on a scheduled basis and retrieves the data file.

                                                                              i.       Connection failures will be logged (to the extent possible) and the contents of the log will be emailed to a monitored JHU email address.

b.       System validates the file (format, data types, other data reasonableness checks)

c.       If valid, the file is retrieved/stored successfully, a log entry is made in the system recording the successful retrieval, and an email message containing the contents of the log entry is emailed to the email address on file for the given state.

d.       If invalid, the file is not stored, a log entry is made in the system recording the unsuccessful attempt and associated errors, and an email message containing the contents of the log entry is emailed to the email address on file for the given state.

e.       Note: This option will require as many different scripts/connectors as there are participating states.  There may be some commonality between them if multiple states use the same underlying data portal software (for example, CT uses [Socrata](https://dev.socrata.com/), which has a published API).  Each of these will need to be maintained.  Each state will need to provide a point of contact for JHU to work with to resolve problems (initial and ongoing).  Furthermore, this option assumes that the State already has a defined process and schedule for storing data in its own data portal.

3\.       Scheduled push of data by State from State to JHU (Automated)

a.       State, using an example script provided by JHU, connects to JHU on a scheduled basis and pushes the data file to JHU’s data portal.

                                                                              i.       The State will be responsible for monitoring/logging connection failures and notifying JHU if warranted.

b.       System validates file (format, data types, other data reasonableness checks)

c.       If valid, the file is stored successfully, a log entry is made in the system recording the successful push, and an email message containing the contents of the log entry is emailed to the email address on file for the given state.

d.       If invalid, the file is not stored, a log entry is made in the system recording the unsuccessful attempt and associated errors, and an email message containing the contents of the log entry is emailed to the email address on file for the given state.

e.       Note: This option will require the State to be able to implement and troubleshoot the script (initially and ongoing), though certainly JHU would provide support for problems on the JHU side.  Furthermore, the State should have a way to schedule such that it can be run on a regular basis without human intervention – if this isn’t possible, this option would provide no benefit over option 1\.

For the production environment, JHU intends to provide as many of these methods as the states need.  However, the timeframe for the pilot is short enough that JHU may not have time to develop all three within the pilot period. 

For that reason, we would like to know each state’s preferences (ranked 1-3) *for the pilot* so that we can focus our efforts on the method(s) that serve the most participating states.  To indicate that a given option is simply not possible for your state, please omit it entirely from your rankings (so, you would end up with only one or two methods in your rankings, but not all three).  To be clear, we are ***not*** asking for preferences for the production system, to which JHU will certainly add features over time.

Finally, if your state has a data portal, can you please tell us which software you use for it and link to its developer documentation (if available)?

## **File Naming Convention**

JHU will not alter the contents of submitted files.  However, we will rename them according to the following convention:

\[Submission Date/Time Stamp\]\_\[State 2-letter Abbreviation\]\_\[Username who submitted\].csv
