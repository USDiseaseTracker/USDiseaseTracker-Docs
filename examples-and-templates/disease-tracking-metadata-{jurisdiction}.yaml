  description: >
    If using CCCD, set method_type to 'cccd'.

    a detailed description below.
  
  # Only complete this if method_type is 'custom'
  custom_hierarchy_description: >
    Provide detailed description of custom date hierarchy here if method_type is 'custom'. 
    Include the order of dates considered (e.g., earliest date, date of onset, lab date, 
    report date) and logic for how cases are classified in time.

# Geographic Units
# List all geographic unit names and levels used by this jurisdiction
geographic_units:
  description: List all geographic unit names and levels used by this jurisdiction
  
  # List each geographic unit used
  units:
    - geo_unit: state
      geo_name: State Name
      parent_jurisdiction: NA
      notes: Any additional notes about this geographic unit
    
    - geo_name: county
      geo_name: [Example1 County, Example2 County, etc.] 
      parent_jurisdiction: State abbreviation (if applicable)
      notes: Any additional notes about this geographic unit
  
  # List the geo_unit levels used (e.g., county, state, region, planning area, hsa)
  geo_unit_levels:
    - county
    - state
  
  notes: >
    Add any additional notes about geographic unit definitions, naming conventions, 
    or special cases (e.g., how planning areas are defined, what constitutes a

# Data Suppression Policies
# Rules and policies for data suppression to protect patient privacy
data_suppression_policies:
  description: Rules and policies for data suppression to protect patient privacy
  
  # Small count suppression rules
  small_count_suppression:
    threshold: 5
    rule_description: >
      Describe the rule for small count suppression. For example: 
      'Any count less than 5 is suppressed and aggregated into the unspecified category.'
    applies_to:
      - geographic units
      - age groups
      - disease subtypes
  
  # Secondary suppression (to prevent calculation of suppressed values)
  secondary_suppression:
    rule_description: >
      If secondary suppression is used, describe the rules here.
  
  # How suppressed counts are aggregated (leave this unless you are explicitly doing something different)
  aggregation_of_suppressed_counts:
    method: unspecified_category
    description: >
      Suppressed counts are aggregated in a row with geo_name='unspecified' 
      (or age_group='unspecified', disease_subtype='unspecified' as appropriate) 
      to ensure totals add up correctly.
    notes: >
      All suppression is applied prior to data submission. Suppressed values are never 
      included in individual rows but are always included in aggregate unspecified categories.
  
  additional_policies: >
    List any other suppression policies or rules that apply to the data, such as 
    policies based on population size, geographic area, or other factors.
